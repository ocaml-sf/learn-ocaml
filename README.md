Learn-OCaml
===========

This is Learn-OCaml, a platform for learning the OCaml language,
featuring a Web toplevel, an exercise environment, and a directory of
lessons and tutorials.

A demo is available [online](https://ocaml-sf.org/learn-ocaml-public/).

The public instance of Learn OCaml uses the Fontin font instead of
Biolinum. This font is licensed under the exljbris Font Foundry Free
Font License Agreement, which, to our understanding, does not allow us

optionally have to procure the files by yourself while building the
app. If not, the CSS provides a reasonable fallback font.
