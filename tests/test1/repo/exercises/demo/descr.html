  This exercise is just a demo for the exercise environment.

<h2>The task</h2>

<p>
  In this test-bed exercise you are asked to (re)implement the basic
  integer-arithmetic functions.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>plus</code> of type <code>int -> int -> int</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>minus</code> of type <code>int -> int -> int</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>times</code> of type <code>int -> int -> int</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>divide</code> of type <code>int -> int -> int</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The preloaded template contains a minor syntax error and is only a
  partially valid answer. These errors were introduced in order to let
  you experiment with the error reporting mechanism and the grading
  report. Try the <code>Check</code> button, for instance.
  <br/>
  Feel free to introduce more errors and to stress the system,
  the resulting grade for this exercise will not be taken into account
  in the global grade and you might submit as many solutions as you
  wish.
  <br/>
  If you end up writing an infinite computation, the system will
  detect it after a while and ask you to stop the script. It will
  slow your browser down until that point, since everything is done
  on your side, via your JavaScript engine.
  So don't worry, you can try and break the system as much as you
  want, it should not break anything on our servers.
