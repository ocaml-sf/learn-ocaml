Andreas,

Metis can be used for non-commercial projects without any restrictions.
For commercial-use, the essential restriction is for the vendors not to
be reselling Metis.

regards,

george

Subject: Metis license conditions

Hello,

I'm maintaining an open-source project for nonlinear optimization (Ipopt 
at COIN-OR, see http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt).  This project requires a 
linear solver, and I set up Makefiles for users who only have to download 
the sources (such as for MUMPS and MA57).  I recently added such a 
Makefile for Metis, since it improves the performance of the linear 
solvers (and therefore of Ipopt).

Of course, I do not distribute the sources for any third-party code, but I 
tell users how they can download the code and where they can learn more 
about the license conditions.  For Metis, I only found the last answer in 
the FAQs.

My colleague Anshul Gupta tells me that the license conditions for Metis 
are somewhat in flux.  However, could you please let me know what I can 
tell users regarding the Metis license?  I would add your answer (possibly 
verbatim) to the INSTALL.Metis file in

https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/browser/ThirdParty/Metis/trunk/INSTALL.Metis

Thank you very much in advance!

Best regards,

Andreas
