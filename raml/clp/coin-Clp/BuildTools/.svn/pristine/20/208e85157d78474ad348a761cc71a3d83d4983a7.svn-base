#      Mods to allow variations from standard package structure. Decision to
#      process a configure.ac file is based on presence of COIN macros.
#      Directories specified on the command line are recursively searched
#      for configure.ac files. Install-sh signals an independent unit.

#      More mods to maintain flexibility but be a bit less aggressive about
#      forcing installation of autotools auxilliary scripts. Also add some
#      command line options and restore ability to specify individual
#      directories on the command line.

# run_autotools takes care of running the autotools (automake, autoconf,
# and helpers) and also makes a few arrangements for when configure and
# libtool execute at configuration, build, and installation.

# Run_autotools can be given a set of directories on the command line; if none
# are specified, it assumes the current directory (`,').  Subdirectories are
# searched for configure.ac files unless suppressed with the -nr option.
# Autotools will consider a directory for processing if any AC_COIN_ macro is
# present in the configure.ac file. Should it be necessary to fool this script
# into processing a file that otherwise contains no COIN macros, just add a
# line with AC_COIN_.  The resulting list is winnowed to remove directories
# specified in COIN_SKIP_PROJECTS.

# Each directory processed gets a temporary link to BuildTools, unless a
# BuildTools subdirectory is already present. Mostly this is a convenience, but
# one thing makes it mandatory: Many Makefile.am files in COIN use an include
# directive to pull in BuildTools/Makemain.inc. There's no way I (lh) can see
# to alter the path that's hardcoded in the include directive. Just to make it
# more interesting, COIN projects are generally constructed with the assumption
# that BuildTools will be one or two directories up, so you'll see things like
# `include ../BuildTools/Makemain.inc'. run_autotools doesn't understand this
# hierarchy, so it keeps all those temporary BuildTools links until the very
# end. That way, it works with the old-style COIN organisation where a
# BuildTools directory is pulled in as an external in the top directory of a
# package, and with the new-style independent organisation, where there may be
# only a single copy of BuildTools out there somewhere.

# If any subdirectory queued for processing is found to contain an install-sh
# script, it is treated as an independent unit (i.e., you can run `make
# install' from this directory) and the set of auxilliary scripts is refreshed
# from BuildTools.  You can force installation of install-sh and associated
# scripts with the -i option. It's good to read the autoconf documentation for
# AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR if this doesn't make sense to you.

# Make sure we bail out if there is an error
set -e

# Define a cleanup function. We'll set a trap below, just before we start to
# do actual work.

# Convert the prefix to an absolute path, if needed, and clean it up, removing

  -i  | --independent    install scripts necessary for an independent unit

  If no directories are specified, the tree rooted at the current directory
  is searched recursively for directories with configure.ac files containing
  COIN configuration macros (AC_COIN_*) and autotools is run in those
  directories. Directories listed in COIN_SKIP_PROJECTS are skipped.
  If directories are specified on the command line, the search for configure.ac
  files is restricted to the specified directories.

  If directories are specified on the command line *and* --no-recursion is
  given, the specified directories are processed with no checks.

  The --independent option will force installation of install-sh and other
  scripts necessary for a unit that is installed independently. This will
  be forced in *all* directories processed. Most often what is desired is
  to install these scripts in the top-level directory of a unit, so -i
  forces -nr. It's a good idea to explicitly specify the directories you want
  to process.
