  module Ast_checker : sig

    (** Since the user's code is reified, the parsed abstract syntax
       tree is available in the testing environment, as a variable
       named [code_ast], with type [Parsetree.structure]. As such, it
       can be checked using the iterators in the module [Ast_mapper]
       from [compiler-libs]. However, [Test_lib] provides some
       functions to check the Parsetree. *)

    (** {2 Checkers} *)

    (** The functional type ['a ast_checker] describes the functions
       used for AST introspection. Such a function takes as input the
       introspected objects (mainly [Parsetree structure] like
       [code_ast] or [Parsetree expression]).

       For example, adding [~on_open: (forbid "open")] will prevent the
       student from using [open] syntax by returning a [Failure]
       report at the first occurrence of the [open] keyword in the
       input [Parsetree] structure or expression.

       This function has several optional arguments to describe the
       behavior of the AST checker on various parts of the AST. Each
       argument corresponds to a specific type:

        - [~on_expression]: [Parsetree.expression] ;

        - [~on_pattern]: [Parsetree.pattern] ;

        - [~on_structure_item]: [Parsetree.structure_item] ;

        - [~on_external]: [value_description] ;

        - [~on_include]: [Parsetree.include_declaration] ;

        - [~on_open]: [Parsetree.open_description] ;

       Besides, there are more high-level checkers:

        - [~on_module_occurence]: this function is called each time a
       module is used. The string input is the name of the module.

        - [~on_variable_occurence]: function called each time a free
       variable (relative to the AST given as argument) is used.
       The string input is the name of the variable. The functions
       [restrict] and [forbid] can be used to construct this function.

        - [~on_function_call]: function called each time a function
       call is used. The first argument of this function is the
       [Parsetree.expression] of the called function. The second
       argument is the arguments represented by a tupple [(name,
       expression)].

  - [test_function_<args_nb> ty name tests]

  - [test_function_<args_nb>_against ty name rf tests]

  - [test_function_<args_nb>_against_solution ty name tests]

       It tests [args_nb]-arity function named [name] with
       non-polymorphic type [ty] (a polymorphic function must be
       tested on a completly determined type) through tests
       [tests]. If a function named [name] is defined in the student
       code and has the right type (or a more generic one), tests
       [tests] are checked one by one and the function returns a
       report concatening reports of each test. Otherwise a

    (** The various grading functions use numerous common optional

       tested inputs, the student {!type:result} and the solution
       {!type:result} and returns a new report which is concatened to
       reports built with [~test], [~test_sdtout] and [~test_sdterr].
       Enables for example to inspect references introduced with
       [~before], [~before_user] or [~before_reference] and build an
       appropriate report. Default value is [fun _ _ _ -> []].

    {3 ?before} defines a function called right before the application
       of student function to the current tested inputs. Default value
       is [fun _ -> ()]

     For [test_function_<args_nb>] only.

    {3 ?before_reference} defines a function called right before the
       application of solution function to the current tested
       inputs. This function is called {b before} student function
       evaluation. Default value is [fun _ -> ()].

     For [test_function_<args_nb>_against] and
       [test_function_<args_nb>_against_solution].

    {3 ?before_user} defines a function called right before the
       application of student function to the current tested
       inputs. This function is called {b after} solution function
       evaluation. Default value is [fun _ -> ()].

     For [test_function_<args_nb>_against] and
       [test_function_<args_nb>_against_solution].

    {3 ?gen} Number of automatically generated tested inputs. Inputs
       are generated using either sampler defined in the current
       environment or function defined with [~sampler] optional
       argument. By default, [gen] is [max 5 (10 - List.length

     For [test_function_<args_nb>_against] and
       [test_function_<args_nb>_against_solution].

     See {{!Sampler.sampler_sec}Sampler module}.

    {3 ?sampler} defines the function used to automatically generated
       inputs. If unset, the grading function checks if a sampler is
       defined for each input type in the current environment. Such
       sampler for a type [some-type] must be named [sample_some-type]
       and have a type [unit -> some-type] if not parametric or [(unit
       -> 'a) -> (unit -> 'b) -> ... -> unit -> some-type] otherwise.

     For [test_function_<args_nb>_against] and
       [test_function_<args_nb>_against_solution].

     See {{!Sampler.sampler_sec}Sampler module}.

    {3 ?test} defines the function used to compare the output of
       student function and the output of solution function. Default
       value is {!Tester.test}.

     See {{!Tester.tester_sec}predefined testers and tester builders}.

    {3 ?test_sdterr} defines the function used to compare the standard
       output produced by student function and the one produced by

     See {{!Tester.io_tester_sec}predefined IO testers and IO tester
