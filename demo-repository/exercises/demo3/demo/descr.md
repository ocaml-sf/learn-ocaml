## Questions

Define four functions matching the usual arithmetic operations:

```
plus : int -> int -> int
times : int -> int -> int
minus : int -> int -> int
divide : int -> int -> int
```

## Bonus question

The hidden prelude (so-called `prepare.ml`) contains a predicate

`mystere_int : int -> bool`

so could you find for which `n` we get `mystere_int n = true` ?
