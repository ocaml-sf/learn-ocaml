  This exercise is just a demo for the exercise environment.

<h2>The task</h2>

<p>
  In this test-bed exercise you are asked to (re)implement the basic
  integer-arithmetic functions.
</p>

<p>
  You are also asked to write test suites for these functions. A test
  suite is specified as a list of input/expected output pairs. These
  tests will be run against some buggy programs to test their coverage.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>plus</code> of type <code>int -> int -> int</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Write some test cases for this function in the variable
        <code>plus_tests</code>. Your test cases should be pairs of type
        <code>(int * int) * int</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>minus</code> of type <code>int -> int -> int</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Write some test cases for this function in the variable
        <code>minus_tests</code>. Your test cases should be pairs of type
        <code>(int * int) * int</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>times</code> of type <code>int -> int -> int</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Write some test cases for this function in the variable
        <code>times_tests</code>. Your test cases should be pairs of type
        <code>(int * int) * int</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>divide</code> of type <code>int -> int -> int</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Write some test cases for this function in the variable
        <code>divide_tests</code>. Your test cases should be pairs of type
        <code>(int * int) * int</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function <code>sum3</code> of type <code>int -> int -> int -> int</code>.
</ol>

<p>
  The preloaded template contains a minor syntax error and is only a
  partially valid answer. These errors were introduced in order to let
  you experiment with the error reporting mechanism and the grading
  report. Try the <code>Check</code> button, for instance.
  <br/>
  Feel free to introduce more errors and to stress the system,
  the resulting grade for this exercise will not be taken into account
  in the global grade and you might submit as many solutions as you
  wish.
  <br/>
  If you end up writing an infinite computation, the system will
  detect it after a while and ask you to stop the script. It will
  slow your browser down until that point, since everything is done
  on your side, via your JavaScript engine.
  So don't worry, you can try and break the system as much as you
  want, it should not break anything on our servers.

<h2>Displaying Mathematical Formulas</h2>

<p>
  This environment supports mathematical notation using MathJax.
  To write a mathematical expression, you can use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>For <strong>inline math</strong>, enclose your expression between single dollar signs: <code>$...$</code>, or between escaped parentheses: <code>\(...\)</code>.</li>
  <li>For <strong>displayed equations</strong> (centered on a new line), use double dollar signs: <code>$$...$$</code>, or escaped brackets: <code>\[...\]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inline formula: <code>$E = mc^2$</code> or <code>\(E = mc^2\)</code> → renders as: \(E = mc^2\).</li>
  <li>Displayed formula: <code>$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$</code> or <code>\[\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\]</code> → renders as:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
    \]
  </li>
</ul>
